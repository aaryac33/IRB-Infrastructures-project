# IRB-Infrastructures-project

I worked on a project for IRB Infrastructures when I was interning at AssertAI. This project is meant to solve the issues and thefts at the toll booths. This will help smoothen the process and help the company find the missed vehicles using video analysis. Will be updating the detailed process soon!
